# What to Expect from the Publishing Process

Congratulations --- your proposal has been accepted! If you've made it this far, you've probably done a good bit of pre-writing, and you're probably anxious to get started writing. What happens next varies from publisher to publisher, but I'll lay out the basic form of what you can expect.

How long all of this takes depends on the length of your book, and your personal writing speed. Personally, I like an interval of six to nine months for writing the first draft. That's not pushing the author unreasonably, but any longer than that, and you might start to lose interest, or prioritize other things.

## Acquisitions Editor

The Acquisitions Editor (AE) is the person you've probably been talking to while you created your proposal, or the first person who contacted you after you sent your proposal to the publisher. They'll probably handle the next few steps immediately after your proposal has been accepted, specifically, setting you up with a contract. Contract negotiations are a whole different topic that I won't go into in detail here. In general, how much room you have for negotiation depends on the publisher. Smaller publishers may not have the leeway to alter their contracts very much at all (they may not have in-house legal staff to handle it). For larger publishers, they may have so many projects going at once that it doesn't make sense to give one author specialized treatment. In short, your choices in contract negotiation may be "take it or leave it." By all means, ask your editor questions about anything in your contract that you don't understand. Just don't expect to be able to choose your own terms.

You'll probably be asked about projected deadlines, or at least milestones, at this point. Most publishers will be at least somewhat flexible with these. Unexpected things can happen while you're writing a book -- your kid might get sick, you might change jobs, you might win the lottery -- all of which affect your writing time. Most publishers aren't going to hold you to the exact date of your writing deadlines, but they'd like you to be close, so they can plan their schedule. Try to be as realistic as you can with your dates, and let your editor know right away if any obstacles come up.

Once the contract is signed, your acquisitions editor will probably fade into the background. They've got lots of books to sign, and that's where they need to focus their attention. Fortunately, they'll hand you off to a new primary contact.

## Development or Project Editor

The title varies depending on the publisher, but the Development Editor (DE) or Project Editor (PE) will be your primary point of contact throughout the writing process. If anything goes wrong, or you have any questions, this is the first person to get in touch with. They may not know the answer immediately, but they can probably get it.
