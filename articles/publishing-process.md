# What to Expect from the Publishing Process

Congratulations -- your proposal has been accepted! If you've made it this far, you've probably done a good bit of pre-writing, and you're probably anxious to get started writing. What happens next varies from publisher to publisher, but I'll lay out the basic form of what you can expect.

How long all of this takes depends on the length of your book, and your personal writing speed. Personally, I like an interval of six to nine months for writing the first draft. That's not pushing the author unreasonably, but any longer than that, and you might start to lose interest, or prioritize other things.

## Acquisitions Editor

The Acquisitions Editor (AE) is the person you've probably been talking to while you created your proposal, or the first person who contacted you after you sent your proposal to the publisher. They'll probably handle the next few steps immediately after your proposal has been accepted, specifically, setting you up with a contract. Contract negotiations are a whole different topic that I won't go into in detail here. In general, how much room you have for negotiation depends on the publisher. Smaller publishers may not have the leeway to alter their contracts very much at all (they may not have in-house legal staff to handle it). For larger publishers, they may have so many projects going at once that it doesn't make sense to give one author specialized treatment. In short, your choices in contract negotiation may be "take it or leave it." By all means, ask your editor questions about anything in your contract that you don't understand. Just don't expect to be able to choose your own terms.

You'll probably be asked about projected deadlines, or at least milestones, at this point. Most publishers will be at least somewhat flexible with these. Unexpected things can happen while you're writing a book -- your kid might get sick, you might change jobs, you might win the lottery -- all of which affect your writing time. Most publishers aren't going to hold you to the exact date of your writing deadlines, but they'd like you to be close, so they can plan their schedule. Try to be as realistic as you can with your dates, and let your editor know right away if any obstacles come up.

Once the contract is signed, your acquisitions editor will probably fade into the background. They've got lots of books to sign, and that's where they need to focus their attention. Fortunately, they'll hand you off to a new primary contact.

## Development or Project Editor

The title varies depending on the publisher, but the Development Editor (DE) or Project Editor (PE) will be your primary point of contact throughout the writing process. If anything goes wrong, or you have any questions, this is the first person to get in touch with. They may not know the answer immediately, but they can probably get it. They'll likely also coordinate the activities of several other people involved in the process, many of whom you'll never interact with directly. Exactly what they do depends on their job title.

### Development Editor

Not all publishers use DEs anymore, which in my opinion is unfortunate. The DE is the first person who'll read every word of your book, and give you feedback on it. If you're very, very lucky, your acquisitions editor will also be your development editor, meaning she'll have the same vision of the book that you created while you were writing the proposal, but that's very rare. Usually the DE will have a bunch of questions up front to understand the audience, the approach, and the scope -- all the things you defined in your proposal, so the better your proposal, the better the DE can understand it. 

As you write, you'll notify the DE when chapters are ready for review, and she'll read them and send you feedback according to the publisher's procedures. Hopefully, the turnaround time will be pretty short (a week or two), so that you can incorporate the feedback into later chapters as you write them. DEs usually don't check your grammar; that part comes later. They take a broader view of your manuscript, and they ask a lot of questions, things like "What if we switched chapters 4 and 5?" or "I don't think this introduction sets up the chapter well; what if you tried this?" or, most commonly, "You lost me here. Did you mean...?" The DE is the stand-in for your reader; if the DE got lost, the reader probably will too. In technical publishing, the DE usually doesn't have experience writing code (although some do), but they've read a lot of technical books in their career, and they can recognize the patterns of good technical writing. You don't have to automatically obey any suggestion the DE makes; the writing and editing process works best as a discussion. But you should give consideration to what she says, even if you decide not to make a change.

The DE also takes on the project management functions of the Project Editor.

### Project Editor

The Project Editor (PE) is the coordinator for your project. If you're working with a PE, she's likely the point person for a bunch of freelancers who will be the ones actually working on your book. Odds are you'll never speak to a freelancer directly, so the PE is your primary contact for everything going on with your book. As such, you want to keep the lines of communication open. The worse thing an author can do is "go silent" on your PE. That works both ways; the PE shouldn't leave you hanging if you ask a question. 

The PE may employ a freelance development editor, or the publisher may decide that your writing doesn't require development. If a freelancer is used, the PE will likely coordinate any queries and responses during that process. 

Other things the PE (or DE) will handle include getting the marketing process started, processing illustrations (if any), and initiating the cover design. Basically, they're in charge of the details, so you don't have to be. One of their major tasks involves coordinating the technical review.

## Technical Reviewer

The Technical Reviewer (sometimes Technical Editor, or TE) is almost always someone outside the publisher, usually an expert in whatever topic the book is about. Many publishers use just one reviewer per book; some use two or three. A few publishers crowdsource their reviews, for a variety of opinions. Some reviewers are volunteers; others get a small honorarium as a thank-you. Either way, it's not a replacement income. The technical reviewers are instructed to hit the book hard -- test every line of code, try every procedure, consider every opinion, and comment when something's wrong. Sometimes the feedback can be overwhelming, but that's for a reason. Either tech reviewers find this stuff now, or customers find it after the book comes out, and comment on Amazon. As with the DE comments, you don't have to take every tech comment as a direct order. Sometimes they're just differences of opinion, in which case, the person with their name on the cover gets the last word. But if a tech reviewer says that the code doesn't work on his machine, that's worth paying attention to.

Usually you won't have direct contact with the tech reviewers. Your project editor may ask you for recommendations, especially if you're writing about a specialized topic. Before you pick one of your friends or colleagues to be a reviewer, consider whether they'll give you the tough review that will really improve your book. Either way, be sure to thank all your reviewers in the book's acknowledgments. They're providing a critical service.

## Production!

The Production date is a big milestone in the life of your book. When you get to Production, your book should be "feature complete" -- you've said everything you want to say, crossed off any TODOs, your DE has read everything at least once, and you've resolved any outstanding queries. The publisher will likely treat this deadline as set in stone, because there's a lot of coordination around the next steps.

Everybody before this point in your book's life has cared more about the content than the presentation. That is, getting your message across is more important than how you formatted a table, or whether the figure numbers were consecutive. Everybody after this point is concerned with presentation more than content, which is why you need to be "feature complete" at this stage. You won't normally have the opportunity to write new paragraphs or make major changes to code.

That said, this is tech publishing, and we know that sometimes major changes happen to the product you're writing about. That's an emergency, but it's one we're used to. The key is communication -- if you think a major version of a product is immanent, let your editor know in advance. If there's a major change that you didn't see coming, let your editor know as soon as you can.

You may get a new primary contact at this point, probably with a title like Production Editor, although it varies. If there is a Production Editor, she'll coordinate the next several steps, most of which are done by freelancers. If not, your development editor or project editor remains your primary contact, and should give you an outline of what's going to happen next. Some of these next steps need your input, and usually have short turnaround times. If you get confused, ask.
