# Finding a Publisher

[snappy opening]

First, spend a bit of time refining your idea, figuring out exactly what subject you want to cover, and who your prospective book is for. You should also consider whether you want to work with a traditional publisher or try self-publishing. These are fairly complex topics that I'm going to skip over here. I've provided some advice on those matters in [my talk at SeaGL 2017](https://archive.org/details/SeaGL2017WritingTheNextGreatTechBook). 

Assuming you've decided that traditional publishing is for you, your next task is to get your book in front of a publisher and hopefully start on the path to publication. <Do I lay out my street cred here, or leave it for an author bio?> I'll help you with the task of putting your metaphorical best foot forward, and avoiding missteps.

## Identify Your Target

Your first step is to figure out which publisher is the a good fit for your idea. To start, think about the publishers that you buy books from, and that you enjoy. The odds are pretty good that your book will appeal to people like you, so starting with your favorites makes for a pretty good short list. If you don't have much of a book collection, you can visit a bookstore, or take a look on Amazon. Make a list of a handful of publishers that you personally like to start with.

Next, you'll need to winnow your prospects. While most technical publishers look alike from a distance, they often have distinctive audiences. Some publishers go for broadly popular topics, such as C++ or Java. Your book on Elixir may not be a good fit for that publisher. Likewise, if your prospective book is about teaching programming to kids, you probably don't want to go with the traditional academic publisher. 

Once you've identified a few targets, do some more research into the publishers' catalogs, either on their own site, or on Amazon. See what books they have that are similar to your idea. If they have a book that's identical, or nearly so, you'll have a tough time convincing them to sign yours. That doesn't necessarily mean you should drop that publisher from your list. You make some changes to your proposal to differentate it from the existing book: target a different audience, or a different skill level. Maybe the existing book is outdated, and you could focus on new approaches to the technology. Make your proposal into a book that complements the existing one, rather than competes. 

If your target publisher has no books that are similar, that can be a good sign, or a very bad one. Sometimes publishers choose not to publish on specific technologies, either because they don't believe their audience is interested, or they've had trouble with that technology in the past. New languages and libraries pop up all the time, and publishers have to make informed guesses about which will appeal to their readers. Their assessment may not be the same as yours. Their decision might be final, or they might be waiting for the right proposal. 

## Work Your Network

Identifying a publisher is only the first step. Unfortunately, publishing is still about who you know, more than what you know. What you're looking for is an "acquisitions editor," the editor whose job is to find new markets, authors, and proposals. If you know someone who has connections with a publisher, ask for an introduction to an acquisitions editor. These editors often specialize in particular subject areas, particularly at larger publishers, but you don't need to find the right one yourself. They're usually happy to connect you with the correct person. 

Sometimes you can find an acquisitions editor at a technical conference, especially one where the publisher is a sponsor, and has a booth. Even if there's not an acquisitions editor on site at the time, the staff at the booth can put you in touch with one. If conferences aren't your thing, you'll need to work your network to get an introduction. Use LinkedIn, or your informal contacts, to get in touch with an editor.

For smaller publishers, you may find acquisitions editors listed on the company website, with contact information if you're lucky. If not, search for the publisher's name on Twitter. You might be nervous about trying to reach out to a stranger over social media to show them your book, but making contact is what acquisitions editors do. 

Once you've made contact, the acquisitions editor will assist you with the next steps. They may have some feedback on your proposal

## If All Else Fails

If you can't find an acquisitions editor to contact, the publisher almost certainly has a blind proposal alias, usually of the form proposals@[publisher].com. Check the web site for instructions on what to send to a proposal alias; some publishers have very specific requirements. This is where it helps to have a real human involved, in case you have questions. Put together what they've asked for (which I'll discuss in another article), send it in, and hope for the best.

## And...Wait

No matter how you've gotten in touch with a publisher, you'll probably have to wait. If you submitted to the proposals alias, odds are it's going to take a while before somebody does anything with that proposal, especially at a larger company. Even if you've found an acquisitions editor to work with, you're probably one of many prospects she's working with simultaneously, so you might not get rapid responses. Almost all publishers have a committee that decides on which proposals to accept, so even if your proposal is awesome and ready to go, you'll still need to wait for the committee to meet and discuss it. You might be waiting several weeks, or even a month before you hear anything.

After a couple of weeks, it's fine to check back in with the editor to see if they need any more information. You want to be polite in this e-mail; if they haven't answered because they're swamped with proposals, being pushy isn't going to get you to the front of the line. It's possible that some publishers will never respond at all instead of sending a rejection notice, but that's uncommon. There's not a lot to do at this point other than be patient. Of course, if it's been months and nobody's returning your e-mails, you're free to approach a different publisher or consider self-publishing.
