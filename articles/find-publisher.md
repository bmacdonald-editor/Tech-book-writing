# Finding a Publisher

You have an idea, you've refined it, and you've decided you want to approach a traditional publisher. Now what?

## Identify Your Target

First, figure out which publisher is the best fit for your idea. If your prospective book is about teaching programming to kids, you probably don't want to go with the traditional academic publisher. Think about the publishers that you buy books from. If you don't happen to own any books, visit a bookstore, or take a look on Amazon. Make a list of a handful of publishers that you personally like, and that seem to be a good general fit.

Once you've found those, do some more research into the publishers' catalogs, either on their own site, or on Amazon. See what books they have that are similar to your idea. If they have one that's identical, or nearly so, you'll have a tough time convincing them to sign yours, unless you make some changes to differentate it. If they have no books that are similar, that's a warning, but not necessarily a deal-breaker. Sometimes publishers choose not to publish on specific technologies, either because they don't believe their audience is interested, or they've had trouble with that technology in the past. But maybe they're just looking for the right proposal, and it hasn't come along yet.

## Work Your Network

Unfortunately, publishing is still about who you know, more than what you know. What you're looking for is an "acquisitions editor," a person at a publisher whose job is to find new markets, authors, and proposals. For smaller publishers, you may find them listed on the company website, with contact information if you're lucky. If not, you'll have to go find them. Sometimes you can find an acquisitions editor at a conference where the publisher is a sponsor, if they have a booth. Even if there's not an acquisitions editor on site at the time, the staff at the booth can put you in touch with one. 

If conferences aren't your thing, you'll need to work your network. If you have an acquaintance who's written, ask for an introduction to their editor. If not, try LinkedIn, or search for the publisher's name on Twitter. It may feel creepy to e-mail a stranger to ask about your book, but making contact is what acquisitions editors do. They probably won't be offended if you contact them via social media, although they may ask to continue the discussion via e-mail. Once you've made contact, the acquisitions editor can walk you through the proposal process.

## If All Else Fails

If you can't find an acquisitions editor to contact, the publisher almost certainly has a blind proposal alias, usually of the form proposals@[publisher].com. Check the web site for instructions on what to send to a proposal alias; some publishers have very specific requirements. This is where it helps to have a real human involved, in case you have questions. Put together what they've asked for (which I'll discuss in another article), send it in, and hope for the best.

## And...Wait

No matter how you've gotten in touch with a publisher, you'll probably have to wait. If you submitted to the proposals alias, odds are it's going to take a while before somebody does anything with that proposal, especially at a larger company. Even if you've found an acquisitions editor to work with, you're probably one of many prospects she's working with simultaneously, so you might not get rapid responses. Almost all publishers have a committee that decides on which proposals to accept, so even if your proposal is awesome and ready to go, you'll still need to wait for the committee to meet and discuss it. You might be waiting several weeks, or even a month before you hear anything.

After a couple of weeks, it's fine to check back in with the editor to see if they need any more information. You want to be polite in this e-mail; if they haven't answered because they're swamped with proposals, being pushy isn't going to get you to the front of the line. It's possible that some publishers will never respond at all instead of sending a rejection notice, but that's uncommon. There's not a lot to do at this point other than be patient. Of course, if it's been months and nobody's returning your e-mails, you're free to approach a different publisher or consider self-publishing.
