## Outline

Chapter 1 problems.
If you're writing a book on CoolFramework.js, don't create a Chapter 1 called "What is CoolFramework.js?" The reader already bought a book about CoolFramework.js. You can assume they know what it is, and that they want to learn more about it. You don't need to convince them. Also, don't call it "Introduction." The front matter of the book contains a Preface or Introduction (yes, they have slightly different meanings, but in practice, they're the same thing), so you don't need to repeat it in Chapter 1.
Similarly, don't give in to the temptation to make Chapter 1 a "History of the Internet" or "How we got here" chapter. Readers probably aren't interested in how we got to the situation that requires this tool; they want to start using it. Chapter 1 should always have the reader do something, even if it's just writing a Hello World. They should feel that they've accomplished something, taken the first step.
Make your chapter titles active -- they should indicate what the reader will be able to do after reading the chapter. Again, think verbs, not nouns. "Modules" is a poor chapter title. "Partitioning Your Code with Modules" tells me more.
Try to include at least level-1 and level-2 subheadings in your outline. It may not be entirely clear what your structure is from the outline, but you'll get more out of subheads than descriptive paragraphs.
