# Why Write a Tech Book?

Before you sit down to write a technical book, ask yourself: Why are you doing this in the first place? Hopefully, an answer springs immediately to mind. If not, you should probably set aside some time to think about it. Individual reasons are many and varied, but they usually fall into one of three categories:

1. You want to share what you know
2. You want the fringe benefits
3. You want to make money

All three of these motivations are valid, and authors-to-be usually have all three in some combination. Let me explain them a bit more fully.

## Sharing Knowledge

I like to call this one the "open source motivation." You know something, and you want to share it. Maybe it's something that other people just don't know about yet, like a new JavaScript library your friend wrote yesterday. Maybe it's something that caught your attention, but hasn't been widely discussed, so you want to amplify the signal, like a clever solution you found in a dusty corner of Reddit. Your motivation doesn't have to be pure and altruistic, though. Maybe there's a technology that everybody says is difficult (monads, I'm looking at you), but you've thought of the perfect way to explain it that should be crystal-clear to everyone. Or maybe everybody has been talking about a technology in one way, it's gotten calcified, and you're determined to prove them all wrong and shake up their thinking. All of these fall under the umbrella of "sharing what you know."

## Fringe Benefits

When you write a book, you become an author. It doesn't matter how long or short the book is, how many copies it sells, or how many stars it gets on Amazon. Once you've written it, you're a published author, forever. No one can take that status away from you. And certain benefits accrue when you're an author. It looks fantastic on a resume. It could help you get promoted at work, or get a new position elsewhere. Maybe some of your colleagues have written, and you have "book envy." Or it could be less serious -- maybe you like the covers, and you want to see your name on one. Maybe you love the idea of going into a bookstore and finding a book you wrote there. Maybe "write a book" is on your list of things to do before you die. There's nothing good or bad about any of these motivations; all of these things are fun. There's a reason for the famous quote: "I don't enjoy writing; I enjoy having written."

## Show Me the Money

This motivation may seem to conflict with the "open source" motivation I already mentioned, but it really doesn't. Writing a book is a substantial investment of your time and energy. You deserve to be compensated for that. If you think your content is good enough to sell to people, and the customers agree, then you've earned that money. Exactly how much depends on which publisher you choose, or whether you decide to self-publish, but hopefully it's more than nothing. 

## What's Your Motivation?

As I mentioned, most authors have all three motivations in some measure. That's entirely right and appropriate. However, you'll get the most enjoyment out of the writing process, and therefore the best results, if your motivations are in the order listed here. Writing a book is a long process, and it's not always going to be fun. If you're doing it just to raise your profile, there are easier ways to go about it. Struggling through chapters sustained by the thought of your name on the cover is going to wear thin pretty quickly. If you're only in it for the ROI, forget about writing and use that time for consulting instead; you'll probably come out ahead. But if your guiding light is the need to get some new information out there, to help other people have an easier time with their coding projects, to give something to the community, that will keep you at it better than the other motivations. And when you're inspired, the writing is easier (but not always easy), and you'll feel better about the finished product.
